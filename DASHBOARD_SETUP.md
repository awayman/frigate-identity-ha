# Frigate Identity – Dashboard Setup & Further Automations

This guide covers the end-to-end flow: generating the configuration, wiring it
into Home Assistant, and setting up automations for yard safety monitoring.

---

## Part 1 – Generate the Configuration Files

If you have a `persons.yaml` from the [Frigate Identity Service](https://github.com/awayman/frigate_identity_service), point the generator at it:

```bash
pip install pyyaml
python examples/generate_dashboard.py \
    --persons-file /path/to/frigate_identity_service/persons.yaml \
    --output /config/frigate_identity
```

Or supply person names directly:

```bash
python examples/generate_dashboard.py \
    --output /config/frigate_identity \
    Alice Bob Dad Mom
```

The generator writes these files to `/config/frigate_identity/`:

| File | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `mqtt_cameras.yaml` | MQTT `camera` entities — one per person (bounded snapshot) |
| `template_sensors.yaml` | Per-person location sensors + zone-aware supervision binary sensors |
| `dashboard.yaml` | Full Lovelace dashboard YAML (proper `views:` structure) |
| `danger_zone_automations.yaml` | Danger-zone automations *(only when children have `dangerous_zones`)* |

---

## Part 2 – Automated One-Command Setup (Recommended)

If your HA `/config` directory is accessible (HA OS, Container, or SSH), you
can let the generator configure **everything** in a single command:

```bash
python examples/generate_dashboard.py \
    --persons-file /config/persons.yaml \
    --output /config/frigate_identity \
    --ha-config-dir /config \
    --ha-url http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
    --ha-token YOUR_LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN \
    --copy-blueprints \
    --restart
```

What each flag does:

| Flag | What it automates |
|---|---|
| `--ha-config-dir /config` | Writes `packages/frigate_identity.yaml` (wires sensors/cameras/automations into HA). Patches `configuration.yaml` to enable packages if needed. |
| `--ha-url` + `--ha-token` | Pushes the Lovelace dashboard directly via the HA REST API — no pasting required. |
| `--copy-blueprints` | Copies blueprint files to `/config/blueprints/automation/frigate_identity/`. |
| `--restart` | Triggers a Home Assistant restart after all changes. |

**Getting a long-lived access token:**
In HA → Profile (bottom-left) → Security tab → Long-Lived Access Tokens → Create.

After the restart, the Frigate Identity view is live at `/lovelace/frigate-identity`.

### Re-running after changes

When you update `persons.yaml` (add/remove a person), just re-run:

```bash
python examples/generate_dashboard.py \
    --persons-file /config/persons.yaml \
    --output /config/frigate_identity \
    --ha-config-dir /config \
    --ha-url http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
    --ha-token YOUR_TOKEN \
    --restart
```

The package file and dashboard are overwritten in-place; `configuration.yaml`
is not touched again once packages are already enabled.

---

## Part 3 – Manual Setup (Alternative)

Use this path if your HA config directory is not directly accessible.

### 3a. Wire files into configuration.yaml

Add `!include` directives to `/config/configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
mqtt:
  camera: !include frigate_identity/mqtt_cameras.yaml

template: !include frigate_identity/template_sensors.yaml

automation: !include frigate_identity/danger_zone_automations.yaml
```

> **Tip — use HA packages instead:** Add a single `homeassistant: packages:
> !include_dir_named packages` line once, then drop
> `packages/frigate_identity.yaml` (generated by `--ha-config-dir`) alongside
> it. Future re-runs only update that one package file — no further edits to
> `configuration.yaml` ever needed.

Restart Home Assistant.

### 3b. Create the Lovelace dashboard

1. **Settings → Dashboards → + Add dashboard**
2. Title: `Frigate Identity` / Icon: `mdi:account-search`
3. Open the new dashboard → **Edit ✏️** → **⋮ menu → Raw configuration editor**
4. Select all existing content, replace with the contents of `dashboard.yaml`, click **Save**

## Part 4 – Zone Model for Large Yards

For a child playing in a large yard covered by multiple cameras, safety
monitoring uses **two different zone concepts** that serve distinct purposes.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 1 – Frigate camera zones  (per-camera pixel regions)      │
│  Purpose: WHERE is the child within the camera view?             │
│  Set in:  persons.yaml  dangerous_zones                          │
│  Used in: danger_zone_automations.yaml  (location trigger)       │
│  Example: "near_fence", "outside_gate" on camera_backyard        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Level 2 – HA Areas  (Settings → Areas & Zones in HA)            │
│  Purpose: Is an adult in the same PHYSICAL area as the child?    │
│  Set in:  Home Assistant UI – assign cameras to Areas            │
│  Used in: binary_sensor.<child>_supervised  (via area_name())    │
│  Example: cameras "backyard" and "patio" both in Area "Back Yard"│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                             ↓ combined ↓
    Alert when child is in a dangerous Frigate zone  AND  unsupervised
```

### Level 1 – Frigate camera zones: dangerous location detection

Frigate zones are **pixel-region annotations on a single camera**.  They are
the right tool for detecting *where within a camera view* a child is.

For example, on `camera_backyard` you might define:

```yaml
# frigate/config.yml
cameras:
  backyard:
    zones:
      play_area:
        coordinates: 100,400,800,400,800,1080,100,1080  # safe inner area
      near_fence:
        coordinates: 800,0,1280,0,1280,1080,800,1080    # near the perimeter fence
      outside_gate:
        coordinates: 900,0,1280,0,1280,200,900,200      # outside the gate – danger!
```

These zone names go in `persons.yaml` as `dangerous_zones`:

```yaml
persons:
  Alice:
    role: child
    requires_supervision: true
    dangerous_zones: [near_fence, outside_gate]   # Frigate zone names on camera_backyard
```

When Alice's MQTT event shows `frigate_zones: [near_fence]` the generated
automation fires — but only if the supervision sensor is also `off`.

### Level 2 – HA Areas: cross-camera supervision (no extra config needed)

Frigate zones **cannot be shared across cameras** — they are scoped to a single
camera's pixel grid.  For supervision, what matters is whether an adult is in
the **same physical area** as the child, regardless of which camera sees them.

**Home Assistant already solves this with Areas.**  If you assign your cameras
to Areas in HA (Settings → Areas & Zones → your Area → Add Device), the
supervision sensor uses `area_name('camera.<name>')` to resolve zones
automatically at runtime:

```
HA UI:  camera.backyard  →  Area: "Back Yard"
HA UI:  camera.patio     →  Area: "Back Yard"
```

Generated supervision template (no dict baked in):

```jinja2
{# Resolves via HA Area at runtime — no static config required #}
{% set child_zone = area_name('camera.' ~ child_camera) or child_camera %}
{% set adult_zone = area_name('camera.' ~ adult_cam)   or adult_cam %}
{% if adult_zone == child_zone %}
  {# supervised — same HA Area, possibly different cameras #}
{% endif %}
```

Dad visible on `camera_patio` and Alice on `camera_backyard` are both in Area
`Back Yard` → Alice is supervised.  **No `camera_zones` section is required.**

Zone resolution priority (highest to lowest):
1. **Explicit override** in `persons.yaml` `camera_zones` section (edge cases only)
2. **HA Area** — `area_name('camera.<name>')` resolved automatically
3. **Camera name fallback** — same-camera supervision only

### Assigning cameras to Areas in HA

1. **Settings → Areas & Zones** → create an area (e.g. "Back Yard")
2. Open the area → **Add Device** → select your Frigate camera device
3. Repeat for all cameras; cameras covering the same physical space get the same area

Once done, re-run the generator — supervision sensors will automatically use
your area assignments without any `camera_zones` configuration.

### `camera_zones` override (edge cases only)

The `camera_zones` section in `persons.yaml` is still supported for cases where:
- Cameras have no HA Area assigned yet
- You want finer-grained grouping than your HA Area hierarchy provides

```yaml
# persons.yaml — camera_zones is OPTIONAL when cameras are assigned to HA Areas
camera_zones:
  backyard: back_yard    # only needed if camera.backyard has no HA Area
  patio:    back_yard    # only needed if camera.patio has no HA Area
```

### Complete `persons.yaml` example

```yaml
persons:
  Alice:
    role: child
    requires_supervision: true
    dangerous_zones: [near_fence, outside_gate]   # Frigate zones on camera_backyard
    camera: backyard
  Bob:
    role: child
    requires_supervision: true
    dangerous_zones: [near_road]                  # Frigate zone on camera_front_door
    camera: front_door
  Dad:
    role: trusted_adult
    can_supervise: true
    camera: patio

# camera_zones is NOT needed if cameras are assigned to HA Areas.
# Only add this section for cameras without an HA Area assignment.
# camera_zones:
#   backyard: back_yard
#   patio:    back_yard
```

Running the generator with cameras assigned to HA Areas produces:
- A `binary_sensor.alice_supervised` that uses `area_name()` dynamically
- A danger-zone automation that alerts when Alice is in `near_fence` or
  `outside_gate` **and** `binary_sensor.alice_supervised` is `off`

### Blueprint: Supervision Detection

The **Camera Zone Overrides** input defaults to `{}`.  Leave it empty if your
cameras are already assigned to HA Areas — supervision is fully automatic.
Only provide entries for cameras that have no HA Area.

## Part 5 – Available Blueprints

After running with `--copy-blueprints`, five blueprints are available in
**Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**:

| Blueprint | Best for |
|---|---|
| **Child Danger Zone Alert** | Alert when child in dangerous Frigate zone without supervision |
| **Vehicle with Children Outside** | Alert when vehicle detected and children are outside |
| **Supervision Detection** | Camera-zone-aware supervised binary sensor per child |
| **Notification Action Handlers** | "Adult Present" / "View Camera" notification buttons |
| **Unknown Person Alert** | Alert on low-confidence / unrecognised detections |

### Creating a Danger Zone Alert (blueprint walkthrough)

1. **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Create Automation**
2. **Start with a blueprint → "Frigate Identity - Child Danger Zone Alert"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Child Name**: `Alice`
   - **Dangerous Zones**: `["near_fence", "outside_gate"]`
   - **Supervision Sensor**: `binary_sensor.alice_supervised`
   - **Notification Service**: `mobile_app_your_phone`
4. **Save** as "Alice Danger Zone Alert"

Repeat for each child with their own zone list.

### Creating Supervision Detection (if not using the generator)

1. **Create Automation → Start with a blueprint → "Frigate Identity - Supervision Detection"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Child Name**: `Alice`
   - **Trusted Adults**: `["Dad", "Mom"]`
   - **Camera Zone Mapping**: `{backyard: back_yard, patio: back_yard}`
   - **Supervision Timeout**: `60`
   - **Manual Override**: `input_boolean.manual_supervision`
3. **Save**

## Part 6 – Recommended Setup Sequence

```
Step 1  ✅  Install integration (HACS or manual)
Step 2  ✅  Add camera_zones section to persons.yaml (for multi-camera yards)
Step 3  ✅  Run generate_dashboard.py with --ha-config-dir + --ha-url + --ha-token + --copy-blueprints + --restart
Step 4  ✅  Dashboard live at /lovelace/frigate-identity
Step 5  🔲  Create "Manual Supervision" helper (Settings → Helpers → Toggle)
Step 6  🔲  Create Notification Action Handlers automation (blueprint)
Step 7  🔲  Edit danger_zone_automations.yaml — replace notify.notify with your service
Step 8  🔲  (Optional) Create Unknown Person Alert for outdoor cameras
Step 9  🔲  (Optional) Create Vehicle with Children Outside alert
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "Entity not found" / grey cards

The entities were not created. Check:
1. HA was restarted after the generator ran
2. **Developer Tools → States** — search for `alice_location`
3. If missing: check that `packages/frigate_identity.yaml` exists and packages
   are enabled in `configuration.yaml`

### Snapshot card is blank

1. The Identity Service must be running and publishing to `identity/snapshots/{person}`
2. **Developer Tools → MQTT → Listen** → subscribe to `identity/snapshots/#`
3. Verify Frigate has `mqtt.crop: true` for each camera

### Supervision always shows "off" in a multi-camera yard

1. **Check HA Area assignments**: Settings → Areas & Zones → open the area →
   confirm both cameras (child's and adult's) are listed under that area
2. In **Developer Tools → Template**, test the area lookup:
   ```
   {{ area_name('camera.backyard') }}
   {{ area_name('camera.patio') }}
   ```
   Both should return the same area name.  If either returns empty, assign the
   camera to an area in HA, or add a `camera_zones` override in `persons.yaml`
3. If using `camera_zones` overrides, verify the camera names in the mapping
   match the Frigate camera names exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Re-run the generator after making changes and restart HA

### Danger zone alert not firing

1. Check that the `dangerous_zones` names in `persons.yaml` exactly match the
   **Frigate zone names** defined in `frigate/config.yml` for that camera
2. In **Developer Tools → MQTT → Listen**, subscribe to `identity/person/#`
   and walk into the zone — confirm `frigate_zones` in the payload contains
   the expected zone name
3. Check the automation trace in HA for which condition failed

### Dashboard push failed (HA YAML Lovelace mode)

If you see "HA may be in YAML Lovelace mode", your Lovelace is configured via
`lovelace:` in `configuration.yaml`. Switch to storage mode or paste
`dashboard.yaml` manually via the Raw configuration editor.

### Blueprint not appearing in HA

1. File must be in `/config/blueprints/automation/frigate_identity/`
   (re-run with `--copy-blueprints` or copy manually)
2. No HA restart needed — blueprints are hot-loaded
3. Check for YAML syntax errors: **Developer Tools → Template** → paste the
   blueprint YAML to check for errors
